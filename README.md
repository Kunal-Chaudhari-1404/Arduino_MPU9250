# Arduino_MPU9250
MPU9250 sensor is used to measure the direction of the gravitation vector and return the angle between the -Z vector and the gravitation vector.
- Using the default settings after reset the full range of the 16-bit value for each axis corresponds to +/- 2g. Check if the measured values are feasible.
- Calculating the angle between the vector (x y z) you measured and the vector (0 0 1)!
- calculating angle in degree to the serial monitor.
